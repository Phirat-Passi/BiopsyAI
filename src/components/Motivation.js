            Sustainability is the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising our future needs. Therefore, unsustainable progress may result in short-term gains, but it has negative consequences into various dimensions of our lives in the long run such as health degradation, social inequality, and economic instability. Sustainability therefore, is the key ingredient for ensuring that progress is inclusive and beneficial for everyone.

            As we live in and move towards the modern era of mankind, tools that enable us to be productive and efficient at our daily work are at an all-time high. However, the progress that have made can be made sustainable.

            Good health and wellbeing allow people to live fulfilling and productive lives. While we can use the modern day facilities to enhance our lives, good health plays an essential role into unleashing its potential in entirety. Therefore we, as a team had the common realization to promote health and wellbeing.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            While we did want to contribute to the good health we went through our rigorous research and data on many health issues that are currently responsible for deaths thereby, creating havoc. This led us to the following facts:- 
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            Cancer is responsible for an estimated 10 million deaths worldwide each year, making it the second leading cause of death.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            In 2020, there were an estimated 19.3 million new cases of cancer worldwide, with the number expected to rise to 28.4 million by 2040.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            More specifically regarding Brain Tumor there were about 265,000 deaths worldwide in 2019, representing approximately 1.6% of all deaths from all causes.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            Additionally with regards to Leukemia it was estimated (in 2020) that there were approximately 417,000 deaths due to this worldwide, representing approximately 3% of all cancer deaths.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            More than two-thirds of cancer deaths occur in Low and Middle Income Countries, despite these countries accounting for about one-third of the global population. This meant, that even though these countries suffer from a high number of cancer patients, their economic backgrounds hinder them from being detected early on.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            We started searching for methods/cures available for Brain Tumor and Leukemia, what we discovered was that even though we as humans have made great strides and advancements in treating cases of Brain Tumor and Leukemia most treatments rely on the condition that the cancer is detected at an early stage. We took this as the problem we were willing and eager to solve. We recognized that the rate at which cancer cases are increasing is putting stress on the hospital as well as their staff.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            Therefore, we have built a solution to this problem. Our solution makes it easy for doctors as well as the end user to detect cancer (specifically Brain Tumor and Leukemia) using MRI or CT scans of the suspected patient. Our solution does not intend to replace doctors specialized in this field of healthcare, but to help and aid them with their work as the number of cases rise.
            </h1>
            <h1 className='pt-3 tracking-wide'>
            We provide the users with a web interface (integrated with deep learning models) wherein they can upload the MRI or CT scans and in a matter of few seconds, they get to know whether they have Cancer (Brain Tumor/ Leukemia). With this we aim to make it sustainable for doctors to detect a patient's cancer as well as for low income individuals to atleast get the fundamental right to basic healthcare, i.e. knowing if they have cancer and thus getting the required diagnosis.
